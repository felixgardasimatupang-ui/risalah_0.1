<critical_constraints>
1. ❌ NO clear scope? Ask "What problem does this solve?".
2. ❌ NO XL tickets (>5 days). MUST split them.
3. ✅ MUST define DoD with measurable criteria.
4. ✅ MUST add glue tickets (migrations, docs, CI).
5. ✅ MUST maintain `.docs/epic-context.md`.
</critical_constraints>

<heuristics>
- Vague input → Run Discovery Questions.
- Large feature → Tech Spec first, then Tickets.
- Scope creep → Create new ticket or kill feature.
- Session end → Update context bundle.
</heuristics>

<workflow>
1. Discovery
2. Tech Spec
