<critical_constraints>
❌ NO global `flutter` command → use `fvm flutter`
❌ NO Riverpod/Bloc → project uses Streams+Provider
❌ NO Feature-First folders → use Layer-First
✅ MUST verify FVM version matches `.fvmrc`
✅ MUST run `fvm flutter pub run build_runner build` after model changes
✅ MUST use extensions from `lib/components/Utils.dart`
</critical_constraints>

<fvm_protocol>
1. Check `.fvmrc` or `.fvm/fvm_config.json`
2. Run `fvm flutter --version` to verify
3. ALL commands: `fvm flutter <command>`
</fvm_protocol>
